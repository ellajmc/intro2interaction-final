# Assessment 3: Website

In conceptualising the design for the Visuell website, I endeavoured to align with both my academic background and professional interests, focusing on creating a visually engaging portfolio for a branding design company inspired by David Mist’s photography from the ‘60s to the ‘90s. This approach stemmed from a clear understanding of the website's purpose: to showcase Visuell’s work and attract prospective clients.

To establish the foundation of Visuell's identity, I curated a mood board, leveraging it to define the typography and colour palette. While the initial plan was to centre the website around Mist’s photography from Westfield Shoppingtown catalogues, further research led to a broader inclusion of his remarkable works from other areas in his career. Adjustments to the colour palette were made, retaining red as a nod to 'Fashion Affair' magazine, aligning it with the website's refined purpose.

The evolution of the prototype involved exploring various design trends, particularly from the ‘90s era, to enhance user interaction. While initially considering mouse hover effects, I ultimately opted for a grid layout with clear, strong images filled with gradients and text upon hover action, inspired by the era's web design aesthetics. Additionally, the incorporation of marquees featuring company logos Mist had collaborated with reinforces Visuell's credibility and authenticity whilst maintaining the historical context from their original use.

As a company heavily reliant on visual communication, it was imperative to prioritise imagery throughout the website. However, as many of the images sourced from the Powerhouse Collection were copies of printed pieces, they were surrounded by a thick white border. To maintain consistency and structure, I introduced coloured borders to the images to correct their differing thicknesses and ensure a cohesive presentation within the gallery.

Adhering to user-centred design principles, the website's layout was meticulously crafted to mimic real-world reading experiences, enhancing readability and navigation. Feedback-driven features such as hover-initiated colour-changing headers and auto-scrolling elements were implemented to provide users with clear feedback on their actions. Moreover, the inclusion of relevant page titles across the limited three-page structure further enhances user awareness and aids navigation.

In terms of accessibility, a fundamental aspect of user-centred design, I ensured that all images were accompanied by the 'alt' attribute, enhancing accessibility for users relying on screen readers.

Finally, the use of semantic HTML and CSS not only enhances visual aesthetics but also reinforces the priority of usability in web design. By balancing design aesthetics with user-centred principles, the Visuell website blends creativity and functionality to engage its audience effectively.



Note:
Many of the Powerhouse Collection images contained minimal information on the context of the photos. Using the small snippets of facts that could be found, I used a combination of my writing and a GenAI tool to flesh out the information into paragraphs.
