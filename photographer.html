    <h4>Introducing our photographer :</h4>
    <h3>David Mist</h3>
    <p>  
      England-born photographer, David Mist, Mist worked as a photographer in London before coming to Sydney 
      to work with Laurence Le Guay in 1961. Together they established Studio 10, first in Castlereagh Street and then in Surry Hills. 
      Studio Ten was one of Sydney's leading commercial and fashion photography studios from the 1960s through to the 1980s. 
      Mist's work characterises the promotion of fashion in Sydney during this period, whereas the archives of Bruno Benini 
      and Henry Talbot are more characteristic of the Melbourne scene. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As one of Sydney's most active 
      commercial photography studios since the 1950s, Studio Ten produced some memorable Australian images, 
      including images of car parks, hairstyles and protests. Mist continued to run the studio until the 1990s. 
      David Mist's personal portfolio extended into the documentary idiom. In this genre, his major projects include 
      photographs produced for his 'Sydney' and 'Made in Australia' books from 1969 which capture shots of Australian women.
